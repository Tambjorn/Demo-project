The soul-purpose of this project is to make a simple, in practice yet sophisticated note-taking application for the most popular operating-systems out there, that would be iOS, macOS, Windows, Android and Linux. 
Why another note-taking app? Well the simple answear is that i haven't found a beautiful yet very practical app that works on across platforms. You might come to think of an idea for work and write it on the phone but forgets about it when you turn on your computer or whatever. That is just one out of an unlimited amouts of likely situations that i believe the Notey application could solve. 
Experimentwise, the thing that inspires me is the widget function on iphone combined with the festis app on windows. Those things combined could make it more accessible and remindful without being in the face. I want to make this an actuall central feature in peoples digital setup. It should be like having a block of postit cards around all the time, to write and throw away without thinking about it. I dont want to allow creativity, but just pure functionality. 
Design, like post-it cards i want them to have different colors. The standard UI is a single note, when opening the app there is a single note. But then there should be a pile, where all the notes are, which you could organize if you wanted to. The font should be simple but yet pleasing.
